# Studying Time Series using Dynamic Time Warping

Working with time series can sometimes be challenging as we can't always use the usual tools we would use on regular data. In particular, when comparing two regular vectors, i.e. where the vector values are independent of one another, we can compute a distance between the two using any of the many available norms such as the L2-norm (or Euclidian distance). When these vectors are actually time series, this approach is not the best approach anymore and we need distances that can account for the time dimension. In this notebook, we will be focusing on the **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** which is a method for computing the similarity between between two time series. In particular, we will investigate how this metric can be used in a machine learning context for time series classification. Then, we will look into how this distance can be used to time series embedding. And finally, we will see how DTW can be used to produce meaningful averages of time series.
