# Bayesian Statistics

As a part of the Bayesian Statistics project @ ENSAE ParisTech we tried to reproduce the results in "*Transforming Neural-Net Output Levels to Probability Distributions*" by **John S. Denker and Yann LeCun** published in 1990 by Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc. in Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.
